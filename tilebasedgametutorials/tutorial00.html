				Welcome to the first example! It doesn't do much at all so don't try interacting with it. All you need to do is observe the breathtaking beauty of gray squares on a white background. Of course, if you were making a real game, you'd have lots of cool graphics and animations populating the screen, but for the purposes of this tutorial, I didn't think frill was necessary. I hope you like gray.
			</p>
			<canvas class="Canvas" id="display"></canvas>
			<p>
				Alright, so, now that you've seen the map, let's examine how it works. It's nothing complicated: just an array of tile values, a for loop, and the one and only drawImage method used to draw the gray square image to the canvas. The important thing to understand is how to calculate row and column positions in your map given a specific index.
			</p>
			<p>
				This map has 16 columns and 16 rows. You could say that the very first tile is located at index: 0, which is the one dimensional approach to the tile map. You could also say the first tile is located at row: 0, column: 0, which is the two dimensional approach. In order to draw the tiles you see above in two dimensions, you just need to convert index to columns and rows. Here's how:
			</p>
			<p class="Math">
				column = index % map.columns
			</p>
			<p class="Math">
				row = Math.floor( index / map.columns )
			</p>
			<p>
				Now that you have the row and column of the tile at a given index in the map, you can multiply by the tile size to get its physical location on the canvas:
			</p>
			<p class="Math">
				x = ( index % map.columns ) * tile_width
			</p>
			<p class="Math">
				y = Math.floor( index / map.columns ) * tile_height
			</p>
			<p>
				And that's how you draw a two dimensional level from a one dimensional map. You can also use a two dimensional array to store tile maps, but that comes with extra overhead. For instance, this very small level uses one array object to store the map. A two dimensional array would need 16 arrays (one for each row or column) as well as one more to hold all of those, so 17 in all. Now just imagine bigger maps and multiple levels. In all honesty, it's probably not so much overhead, but to me it just seems like clutter.
