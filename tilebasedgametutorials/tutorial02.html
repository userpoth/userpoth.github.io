			<h2> Simple Game Loop </h2>
			<p>
				Before we can get into collision detection or sprite animation, we have to have some way of progressing our game logic over time. You've heard of a "game loop" before. A game loop might look like this:
			</p>
			<p>
				move the player<br>
				do collision<br>
				draw the scene
			</p>
			<p>
				In fact, that's the game loop used in this example. But perhaps more important than having an abstract list of things that happen on each cycle of your game, is the function that actually does the looping. This can be as simple as a while loop that runs forever or a function that perpetuates its own execution indefinitely by calling itself:
			</p>
			<pre class="Math">function loop(){
	loop();
}// Calls itself forever. Will eat your processor.</pre>
			<p>
				The loop used here is a little less intense when compared to those methods, but still in the same vein. Have a look:
			</p>
			<canvas class="Canvas" id="display">
				canvas
			</canvas>
			<p>
				The reason I say it's in the same vein is because it has no restriction on speed. For instance, a while loop will loop as quickly as the hardware will process it. You can see this flaw in game loops in action if you play an old game like the original copies of Doom on a new computer with a beastly processor. The game will loop very quickly, sometimes too quickly to play. The reverse can also happen if you play a newer game on a less powerful machine.
			</p>
			<p>
				Browsers execute one function at a time, however, so any sort of endless loop will freeze your screen. The reason the red square up there isn't crashing your browser is because it's loop function is set to execute on a time delay using "requestAnimationFrame." I'm not going to get into the details of requestAnimationFrame, but, basically, it waits until your browser is ready to draw something and then calls your draw function. Generally, on a good device you can get 60 frames per second with requestAnimationFrame, so it's a pretty efficient way to draw your game with no real limitations.
			</p>
			<p>
				Even though it's a great way to call your drawing functions, it still isn't speed restricted. It will execute as fast as your device will allow it to or as slowly as your device can manage. If you'd like to see this in action, bring this example up on two separate devices (with different capabilities of course). A smart phone and a computer are a good pair to test on. You will see that the red square crosses the screen much faster on the more powerful device.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you are creating a game that only runs on one platform, you don't need to worry about this time discrepancy. But developing games for browsers means your platform could be any number of devices with major differences in computing power. In the next example, we'll look at a much more stable game loop.
