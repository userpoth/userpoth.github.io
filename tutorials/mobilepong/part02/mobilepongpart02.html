			<p>
				Well, Part2 is a pretty easy leap from Part1. There isn't much new code, but I did move some code around in the source, so take a look at it. Functionally, it's the same, though. One thing I did change is a line in the collision code that gets the movement vector of the ball. I was using the ball's current and last position to calculate it's movement vector, which works fine, until the ball hits a wall and both values are set to the same thing. When this happens the movement vector zeros out. If the ball then collides with a paddle, it's movement vector will be zero, which will cause a glitch and send the ball off course. The new code looks like this:
			</p>
			<pre>var ball_vector = new Vector(Math.cos(ball_.direction) * ball_.velocity, Math.sin(ball_.direction) * ball_.velocity);</pre>
			<p>
				Anyway, that cleared up a glitch. If you want to see the old code, I didn't change the last tutorial because for what it does it works just fine.
			</p>
			<p>
				Other than that, adding paddles was pretty easy. The paddle class is simpler than the ball class, so if you're curious take a look at the source. Score keeping was also super simple. Basically, if the ball goes off screen, give the opposite player a point. The score is drawn right onto the canvas using the fillText function.
			</p>
			<p>
				And that's all for this tutorial series. You now have access to all the code and explainations for the more complex logic behind making a Pong game! See it in action: <span id="launch_button">Launch Example</span>!
