<!-- In an effort to make a superb game loop using HTML5 and JavaScript, I'm researching "web workers". -->
<!-- From what I understand they effectively open a parallel thread on which to execute non-document related code. -->
<!-- If you use "transferable objects" you can avoid cloning data when passing info between threads. -->
<!-- Let's see how this works... -->

<!-- Well, after seeing how this works, I'm quite dissapointed. -->
<!-- If there were some way of passing off drawing to a web worker, it would be excellent, but you can't. -->
<!-- Unfortunately the use of postMessage itself is rather costly because it only sends duplicate data. -->
<!-- You can also send ArrayBuffers, which is apparently much faster, but unless you are passing an image or a file, it's not very useful. -->
<!-- Perhaps for excessively heavy computations, I'll use a web worker. Maybe for pathfinding... -->
<!-- The awesome truth is that tile based games just aren't that expensive to run logic for! -->
