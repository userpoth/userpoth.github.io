					<a href="webworker/webworker.html">webworker</a> -- This program may freeze slow devices. It's very cpu intensive. I found that web workers are best used for solving long equations or doing pathfinding. Only pass small amounts of data between threads to maintain efficiency. <span class="Date">04/26/2015</span>

					<a href="webgl/webgl.html">webgl</a> -- Testing out WebGL performance vs stand alone HTML5 canvas. I found that Canvas is much better at rendering many different shapes individually than Web GL. Web GL only gains a performance boost when rendering many uniform shapes in batches, which is impossible to do with randomly sized and colored rectangles. This is probably one of few instances in which Web GL is slower than Canvas. Sidenote: I made an fps counter! <span class="Date">09/02/2015</span>

					<a href="gameloops/gameloops.html">gameloops</a> -- This compares three types of fixed time step game loops: A pure setTimeout game loop, a requestAnimationFrame game loop, and a combination game loop. All three run in the main thread. From what I can tell, the RAF and the combination loops are pretty evenly matched, but the setTimeout loop is not quite as smooth. You can mess around with the number of updates and number of renders to see which loop performs best under different circumstances. I think that the RAF loop is smoothest at reasonable load, but the combination loop performs best under the heaviest load. <span class="Date">09/09/2015</span>
