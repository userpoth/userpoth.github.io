				This is my first game! I wrote it in ActionScript 2.0 and made all the graphics and sound effects myself. Coming back to it now, I realize it's almost impossible to beat. Just a heads up for anyone crazy enough to try and beat it, there's a sixth level that you need a high score to get to. Anyway, have fun playing!

					Press the green light to start the game.

				<li>
					That button in the bottom left adjusts screen size. I guess I thought that was cool for some reason. Press it twice for maximum screen size.
				</li>
				<li>
					Use the arrow keys to move Toader across the road and over the river.
				</li>
				<li>
					Save the five baby toads to get to the next level.
				</li>
				<li>
					Collect white toads to gain an extra life.

				<li>
					Alligators are safe to ride as long as you don't touch their heads!
